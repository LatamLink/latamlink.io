LAC-Chain technology-agnostic, for which we want to be able to integrate several blockchain protocols that are being used in LAC-Chain.

The interoperability between distinct blockchain protocols could be achieved in two ways:

 **Trusted Peers:** This modality is simpler of implement, using a trust layer to determine what occurs in each chain.

 **Trustless:** Is a more difficult solution, specially between protocols POW -> DPOS.

## Ethereum Interoperability => EOSIO

## Ethereum Interoperability ⇔ EOSIO

## EVM on EOSIO

Block.one announced a challenge of a smart contract, offering a prize of 200,000 dollars to who resolved it.

"In this challenge, the participants should create an EOSIO Smart Contract that can store and invoke EVM (Solidity) Smart Contracts in a virtual environment similar to the Ethereum one", is detailed in one announcement of February 3rd in EOSIO DevPost.
