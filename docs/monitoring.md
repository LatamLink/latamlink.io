Monitoring what is happening on the network is essential to improve it and measure the social impact of our solutions. The main objective of the monitoring tools is to produce objective and reliable information about each node and the activity of the network.

The permitting committee reserves the discretionary right to remove a validator node from the production schedule based on node performance data.

## Network Monitor

A native LACChain EOSIO network monitor has been developed as a tool for developers and users for the launch of Pro Testnet. The monitor will incorporate "on-chain" and "off-chain" metrics

The network monitor is available at the following link: ** https://lacchain.eosio.online**

The network monitor is completely open source and you can see the project in the following [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eosio-dashboard)

## On-chain monitoring
There is a collection of [smart contracts and utilities for EOSIO](https://eosmechanics.com/) deployed in LACChain EOSIO for monitoring the performance of nodes in the network. The data will be publicly available for analysis and we encourage you to do so to help identify problems and improve the performance of the validator nodes.

The metrics are generated by smart contracts located under the account [`eosmechanics`](https://explorer.latamlink.io/account/eosmechanics).

### CPU Benchmark
This CPU speed metric uses the CPU time consumed by calculating the Mersenne prime numbers as a benchmark. Prime number calculation is an industry standard for measuring CPU performance and uses code operations that are common in software development.

The `cpu` action is executed during the production shift of each block producer and records the contract execution times using the `cpu_usage_us` field included in all network transactions.

### RAM Benchmark
This metric consists of quickly writing and reading to a RAM table and in a very similar way to the CPU metric it tries to measure the performance of the resources offered by the different validator nodes.

## Off-chain monitoring

The off-chain monitoring consists of the analysis of historical data of the network activity to obtain performance data of the nodes of the network.

The main off-chain metrics for block production and validator node reliability consist of ** lost blocks ** and ** lost rounds **.

### Missed Blocks

This data helps validator nodes identify problems and helps evaluate the performance of the validator node.

The reliability of the production of blocks by the validator nodes is determined by comparing the number of blocks that each validator node must produce with the blocks actually produced.

Missed blocks are the number of blocks scheduled but not produced, or produced and lost for various reasons.

### Missed Rounds

Number of rounds (12 blocks in a row) that the validator node was expected to be part of.

Number of rounds completely lost (12 blocks in a row) by a validator node. This probably (but not always) indicates an issue where the specified validator node is at fault by not being ready to produce in its rounds.


#### Cloud monitoring

Take advantage of the existing cloud monitoring services.

 - Prometheus
 - Grafana

Additionally, we will explore Blockchain Analytics tools and Data Science.
