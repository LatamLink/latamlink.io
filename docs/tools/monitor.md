A native network monitor has been developed as a tool for developers and users prior to launching the LACChain EOSIO Pro Testnet. The network monitor will display both "on-chain" and "off-chain" metrics, please see this article on [network monitoring](../monitoring).

## Link to LAChain EOSIO Dashboard 
The network monitor is available at the following URL: https://lacchain.eosio.online
